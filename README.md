# METARmap #
## By FHT ##

METARmap uses an internet-connected Raspberry Pi to pull ADDS XML feed, and drive NeoPixel LEDs to indicate flight category at airports.

Inspired by post by /u/Grimace06

**Uses rpi_ws281x from JGarff**.

Instructions and info needed to build a METARmap can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/facialhairtuesday/METARmap/wiki)
